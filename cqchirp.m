function x = cqchirp(t,f0,t1,f1,phase,taper)
%x = cqchirp(t,f0,t1,f1) generates samples of a linear swept-frequency
%   signal at the time instances defined in timebase array t.  The instantaneous
%   frequency at time 0 is f0 Hertz.  The instantaneous frequency f1
%   is achieved at time t1.
%   The argument 'phase' is optional. It defines the initial phase of the 
%   signal degined in radians. By default phase=0 radian
% 
% NOTE: WHEN T IS OUTSIDE [0,T1], X = 0
% 
% input
% t ... time vector
% f0 ... frequency at time 0
% t1 ... sweep time from time 0 to time t1
% f1 ... frequency at time t1
% phase ... phase of the sweep in radians
% taper ... time of taper. if taper is scalar then it is applied to
% start and end of the sweep; if taper is [a,b] then a is applied for
% the beginning of the sweep and b is applied for the ending of the
% sweep.
